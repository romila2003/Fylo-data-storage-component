## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a fun challenge to complete and enjoyed recreating the component through HTML and CSS/SCSS. I'm learning how to use SASS correctly trying to incorporate SASS into my projects to help me organise my codes more efficiently. I did find positioning the background to look like the design provided was difficult however I tried my best. Overall, this was an enjoyable project, particularly where it says the remaining storage.
CSS - pseudo class: 

```CSS

&::after {
            content: "";
            position: absolute;
            width: 0;
            height: 0;
            border-top: 40px solid white;
            border-left: 50px solid transparent;
            right: 0;
        }

```

### Continued development

For future developments, I should focus on building web pages to work on my HTML and CSS skills on layouts. Also, I should focus on working with more javascript projects in the junior section.
